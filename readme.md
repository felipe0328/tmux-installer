 # Tmux Installer V1.0

This project aims to easily install tmux on different terminals having the same behavior, for that just run
`./tmux-installer.sh`

after that you just need to open tmux running `tmux` in your terminal, and install the plugins, running `prefix + I`
prefix means the activation button, it can be ctrl+b (by default)  or ctrl+a.

Enjoy it!.
